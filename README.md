The general goal of this project was to utilize webcam images and match them with weather data to predict weather conditions such as weather label, temperature, and wind speed. The images were taken by Kat Kam from English Bay (Vancouver) and the weather data was collected by Canadian government from Vancouver Airport. The project mainly focused on using webcam images and predicting the weather labels. It also tried to detect whether the analysis would benefit if it used cropped images. Finally, the project used the images to predict the temperature and the wind speed.
